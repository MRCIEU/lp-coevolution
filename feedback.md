- Milk type is not convincing
- Discussion of UKBB data is not harmonised with the rest of the paper


Reviewer 1

- The discussion of those results is a bit simplistic
- “What type of milk do you mainly use?” without any reference to the amount consumed, not giving people a chance to indicate Lactose-free dairy
- Many of the non-LP adults included in the “cows’ milk consumer” group are fully aware of the side effect this consumption has on there well-being (e.g. diarrhea) and thus consume only limited amounts, use lactose-free products or take lactase supplements.
- I’m not sure the UK Biobank analyses can be projected too much into the past to shed light on the selective agent that led to high-frequency today – or at least that connection must be discussed more thoroughly than it current is.
- How sure can we be that a lack of these differences in a modern society translates in a lack of these differences in past societies?

Reviewer 2

- I only have the feeling that the UK BioBank part could be better merged textually with the other analyses ("We turned to the UK BioBank ...").
- Line 205: “around 92% .. of genetically LNP participants in the UK BioBank consume fresh cows’ milk which brings into question the widely-held belief that selection against LNP was the result of detrimental effects of milk consumption in otherwise healthy individuals”: This is exciting! I would ask the authors to clarify what exactly is meant by "consume fresh cows' milk". It is not news that LNP individuals can drink a small quantity of fresh milk (up to approx. 200mL) without any negative effect. So what are we talking about here: a sip of milk in the coffee in the morning or regular consumption of larger amounts? Since I am convinced that it will be the former in most cases, it should be pointed out in the text.
- Line 211: While I find that bone mineral density argument convincing, I am not so sure whether the calcium assimilation and the vitamin D hypothesis should necessarily invoke higher serum calcium. High serum concentrations would indicate that calcium-rich foods are consumed but the calcium is not effectively metabolized. I am very surprised that body height shows no correlation. This is where anyone studying the subject would have expected significant signals. Could this be due to the cohort studied, was it filtered geographically or otherwise? I would ask the authors to comment briefly.

Reviewer 3

1. The phenotype which was selected does not reflect milk consumption in terms of quantity but only in terms of quality, it is thus unsurprising that the association is relatively weak. Adding a splash of milk to coffee or tea is hardly going to be an issue even for a lactose intolerant person. In parallel to the Food frequency questionnaire, Uk biobank has administered to its participants also a 24h recall food questionnaire where the quantity of milk consumed was asked. Of the participants only roughly 10-15% have reported drinking “Other non-alcoholic drinks” which includes milk, and this percentage is relatively constant through the different assessment. This suggests that this proportion is not the result of bias but it likely represents the actual milk consumers. Thus the numbers reported which are >90% are not realistic.
The authors should refer to this phenotype rather than “Milk type” if they want to test this association.

3.From a methodological point of view, the association analyses are performed using only 10 principal components which is clearly too little considered the strong deviation from HWE and that this variant strongly associates with geography with the LP allele associating to a south-north and east-west gradient (as expected) even within the UK Biobank samples.
